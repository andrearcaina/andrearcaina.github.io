## part 1 ?

This project [fafnir](https://github.com/andrearcaina/fafnir) is a distributed and scalable microservice backend for trading platforms (will be simulated). 
I'm mainly coding everything in **Go**, but might use **Python**, **Java**, or **C++** down the line depending on the service.

It's meant for my portfolio and to understand modern microservices,
system design patterns, and best coding practices in building a scalable
distributed application. It is not fully implemented yet, but I have been
able to deploy on docker, connect multiple containers and services together,
and utilize a bunch of technologies such as [Redis](https://redis.io/), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), 
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to name a few.

Here is a rough sketch of what I have right now of the system architecture:

Here is the related issue on GitHub: [Implement NATS + auth validation logic #4](https://github.com/andrearcaina/fafnir/issues/4)

Going through, I have many more features to be implemented (check TODO on README), and hopefully learn something new
