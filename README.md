# My Personal Site 

Welcome to my small space on the networking web ðŸ‘‹

Currently displays a little bit about me, my contacts, and some of my recent/beloved projects!

If you are looking at this website from a previous link, I have migrated from using static HTML/CSS and JS to `Next.js` as of 2024-02-14.

Check out the current iteration [here](https://andrearcaina.vercel.app/), deployed using Vercel.
